This is a simple library that uses the openweathermap.org api to take in a location and give basic or complicated 12 hour weather data.
Use of this library requires obtaining a openweathermap api key.

The basic outline of this library is taken from a udemy course I completed:

Credit goes to them for the idea of the sunnyday library
